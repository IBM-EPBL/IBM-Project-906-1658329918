Web Phishing Detection
ABSTRACT:
      
         Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.
An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft. Moreover, phishing is often used to gain a foothold in corporate or governmental networks as a part of a larger attack, such as an advanced persistent threat (APT) event. In this latter scenario, employees are compromised in order to bypass security perimeters, distribute malware inside a closed environment, or gain privileged access to secured data.

PHISHING WORK:
         Anyone who uses the internet or phones can be a target for phishing scammers.
Phishing scams normally try to:
•	Infect your device with malware
•	Steal your private credentials to get your money or identity
•	Obtain control of your online accounts
•	Convince you to willingly send money or valuables
Sometimes these threats don’t stop with just you. If a hacker gets into your email, contact list, or social media, they can spam people you know with phishing messages seemingly from you.
Trust and urgency are what makes phishing so deceiving and dangerous. If the criminal can convince you to trust them and to take action before thinking — you’re an easy target.

TYPES OF PHISHING:
•	Spear Phishing.
•	Whaling.
•	Smishing
•	Vishing.
•	Email Phishing.
Email phishing:
       Email phishing is the most common type of phishing, and it has been in use since the 1990s. Hackers send these emails to any email addresses they can obtain. The email usually informs you that there has been a compromise to your account and that you need to respond immediately by clicking on a provided link. These attacks are usually easy to spot as language in the email often contains spelling and/or grammatical errors.
Some emails are difficult to recognise as phishing attacks, especially when the language and grammar are more carefully crafted. Checking the email source and the link you’re being directed to for suspicious language can give you clues as to whether the source is legitimate.
Another phishing scam, referred to as sextortion, occurs when a hacker sends you an email that appears to have come from you. The hacker claims to have access to your email account and your computer. They claim to have your password and a recorded video of you.
The hackers claim that you have been watching adult videos from your computer while the camera was on and recording. The demand is that you pay them, usually in Bitcoin, or they will release the video to family and/or colleagues.

 RISK OF PHISHING ATTACKS:
      Phishing can affect anyone of any age, whether in their personal life or in the workplace.
Everyone from the elderly to young children are using internet devices nowadays. If a scammer can find your contact information publicly, they can add it to their phishing target list.
Your phone number, email address, online messaging IDs, and social media accounts are harder to hide nowadays. So, there’s a good chance that just having one of these makes you a target. Plus, phishing attacks can be broad or highly targeted in the people they choose to trick.

TYPES OF PHISHING SCAMS:
•	Phishing email appears in your email inbox — usually with a request to follow a link, send a payment, reply with private info, or open an attachment. The sender’s email might be tailored to closely resemble a valid one and may contain info that feels personal to you.
•	Domain spoofing is a popular way an email phisher might mimic valid email addresses. These scams take a real company’s domain (ex: @america.com) and modify it. You might engage with an address like “@arneria.com” and fall victim to the scheme.
•	Voice phishing (vishing) scammers call you and impersonate a valid person or company to deceive you. They might redirect you from an automated message and mask their phone number. Vishers will try to keep you on the phone and urge you to take action.
•	SMS phishing (smishing) similarly to vishing, this scheme will imitate a valid organization, using urgency in a short text message to fool you. In the message, you’ll usually find a link or a phone number they want you to use. Mobile messaging services are also at risk of this.
•	Social media phishing involves criminals using posts or direct messages to persuade you into a trap. Some are blatant like free giveaways or sketchy “official” organization pages with an urgent request. Others might impersonate your friends or build a relationship with you long-term before ‘attacking’ to seal the deal.
•	like coffee shops and airports. This is done in efforts to get you to connect and eavesdrop on all your online activity.
Finally, here are some more types of phishing you should be aware of:
•	Search engine results phishing uses methods to get a fraudulent webpage to appear in search results before a legitimate one. It is also known as SEO phishing or SEM phishing. If you don’t look carefully, you may click the malicious page instead of the real one.
•	Angler phishing impersonates a customer service representative for a real company to trick you out of information. On social media, a fake help account spots your “@mentions” to company’s social handle to respond with a fake support message.
•	BEC (business email compromise) involves various means of breaching a company’s communications circle to get high-value info. This can include CEO impersonation or pretending a vendor with a fake invoice to initiate activities like wire transfers.
•	Cryptocurrency phishing targets those with cryptocurrency wallets. Instead of using long-term means to mine cryptocurrency themselves, these criminals try to steal from those that already have these funds.
The truth is the list of types of phishing attacks is extensive and constantly expanding. These are some of the most common currently, but you might see new ones even in a few months.
Since these scams rapidly change to fit current events, they’ve been hard to spot. But there are ways you can keep yourself safer and being aware of the latest scams is an easy way to start.

EXAMPLES OF COMMON PHISHING SCAMS:
•	Whilst it would be impractical and impossible to list every known phishing scam here, there are some more common ones you should definitely look out for:
•	Iran Cyberattack phishing scams use an illegitimate Microsoft email, prompting a login to restore your data in attempts to steal your Microsoft credentials. Scammers use your fear of being locked out of Windows and the relevance of a current news story to make it believable.
•	Office 365 deletion alerts are yet another Microsoft-related scam used to get your credentials. This email scam claims that a high volume of files have been deleted from your account. They give a link for you to login, of course resulting in your account being compromised.
•	Notice from bank. This scam tricks you with a fake account notification. These emails normally give you a convenient link which leads to a web form, asking for your bank details “for verification purposes.” Do not give them your details. Instead, give your bank a call as they may want to take action on the malicious email.
•	Email from a ‘friend’. This scam takes the form of a known friend who is in a foreign country and needs your help. This ‘help’ normally involves sending money to them. So, before you send your ‘friend’ money, give them a call first to verify whether it’s true or not.
•	Contest winner/Inheritance email. If you’ve won something unexpectedly or received an inheritance from a relative you've never heard of — don’t get too excited. Because, most of the time these emails are scams that require you click on a link to enter your info for prize shipment or inheritance ‘verification’.
•	The tax refund/rebate. This is a popular phishing scam as many people have annual taxes which they pay or have to submit payment to. These phishing messages normally say that you are either eligible to receive a tax refund, or you have been selected to be audited. It then requests that you submit a tax refund request or tax form (asking for your full details), which scammers then use to either steal your money and/or sell your data on.
